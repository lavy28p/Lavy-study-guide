## Overview
Lavy's Study Guide website helps to quickly browse through snippets of videos and interview questions for Backend and Frontend applications. For Start , I'm posting Ruby and PostgreSql materials. This is mainly for short videos and interview questions/answers to go through quickly just before any interviews when the time is really short.

## MVP

> The Minimum Viable Product should be a well-planned, easily-communicated product, ensuring that the client's deliverable will be achievable and meet specifications within the time frame estimated.

_The **Project Title** MVP lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus dapibus fermentum risus vitae bibendum. Integer vel ipsum mollis odio sollicitudin ornare eu vel ex. In quis fringilla velit, ac maximus quam. Etiam eget placerat neque. Aenean faucibus sem non nisi lobortis ullamcorper._

### Libraries and Dependencies

> Use this section to list all supporting libraries and dependencies, and their role in the project. Below is an example - this needs to be replaced!

|     Library      | Description                                |
| :--------------: | :----------------------------------------- |
|      React       | _Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur._ |
|   React Router   | _Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur._ |
| React SemanticUI | _Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur._ |
|     Express      | _Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur._ |

#### Component Tree
This section displays the structure of how the React components are being rendered. It shows the parent to child relation between my components, or in other words, show which components are rendering the other components.

#### Component File Structure

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app. This should be a reflection of how you expect your directory/file tree to look like. 

``` structure

src
|__ assets/
      |__ fonts
      |__ graphics
      |__ images
      |__ mockups
|__ components/
      |__ Header.jsx
|__ services/

```

#### Time Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Add Contact Form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |     2 hrs     |    3 hrs    |
| Create CRUD Actions |    H     |     3 hrs      |     1 hrs     |     TBD     |
| TOTAL               |          |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |

> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evaluate possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._

### Server (Back End)

#### ERD Model

> Use this section to display an image of a computer generated ERD model. You can use draw.io, Lucidchart or another ERD tool.
